Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI has applications in various domains 
such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. It can help doctors diagnose 
diseases, predict stock market trends, personalize learning for students, and even enable 
self-driving cars. However, AI also raises concerns about privacy, bias, and job displacement.
 Therefore, it is important to balance innovation with ethical considerations.
